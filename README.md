# TimerBenchmark

This is a CMake skeleton for C# projects. It is also a kind of benchmark for Windows timer utilities, based on [TimeSpan Calculation based on DateTime is a Performance Bottleneck](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/800756/TimeSpan-Calculation-based-on-DateTime-is-a-Perfor).

## Clonning, Compiling and Running

Make sure you have CMake, Git and a C# toolchain properly installed and issue the following commands:

```batch
git clone https://github.com/tarc/TimerBenchmark.git
cd TimerBenchmark
run.bat
```

The expected output from the above commands is something like:
